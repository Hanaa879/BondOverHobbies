- Background color: Light pink (#FFDDEE), providing a soft, inviting base that complements the scrapbook aesthetic.
- Accent color: Black (#111111), creating contrast and highlighting important interactive elements, text, and icons.
- Secondary accent color: Dark Blue (#003049) to provide depth and highlight key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif with a slightly computerized, modern look, but friendly enough for the subject matter.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets, where needed.
- Use a mix of hand-drawn and digital icons, echoing the scrapbook theme.
- A playful, somewhat chaotic layout with elements that look collaged, similar to a physical scrapbook.
- Use subtle animations to bring a Y2K interactive vibe to the UI. For example, shimmering or bouncing effects on buttons.
